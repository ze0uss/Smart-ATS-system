Applicant Tracking Systems: Everything You Need to Know ??

Most companies today, including over 97 percent of Fortune 500 companies, rely on an applicant tracking system, or ATS, to help them hire new employees.
If you don’t know what an ATS is, you’re not alone. Most job seekers aren’t aware that their resume could be rejected by a computer algorithm without a hiring manager ever seeing it – even if they’re qualified for the job.

In this guide, we’ll tell you what an ATS is, how it works, and how you can create an ATS-friendly resume that will get you more job interviews.


# What is an applicant tracking system?

An applicant tracking system (ATS) is computer software that human resource departments use to process the overwhelming number of applications they receive for job openings.

Specifically, the ATS:

Stores job candidate information like resumes, cover letters, references, and other data.
Tracks job candidates and their application status throughout the hiring pipeline.
Automates time-consuming tasks such as manually screening applicants, reading resumes, scheduling interviews, and sending out notifications.

# How do applicant tracking systems work?

When you submit your application, it usually goes straight into an ATS database. But first you might see some knockout questions.

Knockout questions can be in the style of checkboxes or short answer questions. If you answer any of the knockout questions unsatisfactorily, your resume will either be flagged or automatically rejected by the ATS.

Examples of knock-out questions:

Are you willing to relocate?
Are you willing to travel as part of this job?
Are you willing to work full-time?
Do you have X years of experience?
Do you have a [specific degree or certification] required for this position?
After presenting you with knockout questions, the ATS scans your resume and parses it. This involves sifting through your information and converting it into a structured format.

This information is stored in the ATS tracking database. When recruiters want to find suitable job candidates, all they have to do is search through the database for them.

# How do hiring managers use ATS to find candidates?

Hiring managers use keywords to find suitable job candidates in the ATS database. A keyword can be a single word or a phrase. Most keywords are job titles or skills.

For example, if a hiring manager is searching for a dental assistant, they might type the keyword “dental assistant” into the ATS search bar.

Hiring managers can also type in multiple terms. For example, “dental assistant” might be combined with “X-ray certification” and “patient care.”

Resumes that contain all three keywords will appear to the hiring manager. Resume that don’t contain all three keywords will remain hidden in the ATS database.

# Here’s an example of what an ATS search looks like:

Below is what the search page for the ATS called Bullhorn looks like. The hiring manager is trying to find a job candidate with the keyword “PHP” in their resume. It would also be nice if they had C++, Java, and Photoshop skills, although they aren’t required.

When the hiring manager hits the search button, only resumes with the keyword “PHP” will appear.

As you can see below, the resume of the candidate named Joe Jones contains the required keyword “PHP” and the optional keyword “Java”.


# What is a resume score and how can you increase it?

Some ATS score resumes based on how closely they match the job description. This score is based on your resume as a whole. It takes into account your work experience, skill set, education, and more.

If your resume doesn’t have a high enough score, it might not be considered for further consideration.

Here’s an example of how the ATS called Taleo scores resumes (it uses the term “Req Rank” instead of score).
The higher your score, the better your chances of getting an interview.

To increase your score, read the job description and highlight the keywords that appear most frequently. Pay particular attention to keywords that are hard skills.

Hard skills are specific abilities that are usually acquired through training or education. Examples of hard skills include graphic design, Salesforce, data analysis, project management, Python, and SEO.

In other words, try to use the same words on your resume that the hiring manager used in the job description. This will make your resume easier to find, resulting in more job interviews.
